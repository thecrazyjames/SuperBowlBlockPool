# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Working towards maknig a fully functioning Super Bowl Block pool application.

The goal is to integrate a Twilio API and some sort of Sports API which will text you mid game to let you know what your odds of winning are after major scoring events (in football, not high scoring sports like Basketball).

# The admin for the game will also be able to

change the rules of the game such as the size of the block pool
the frequency of pay outs (every quarter, each half, the whole game)
the amount of each pay out
whether or not the admin gets a cut or if a certain percentage of the winnings goes towards a charity or organization
board customization

There is a potential to integrate some sort of payment service also which requires you to pay money up front in order to reserve a spot. This ensures payment to the winner.
